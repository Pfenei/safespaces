                                    <p>The term “Safe Space” involves places for ostracised individuals where
                                        they are free
                                        of any kind of violence that could stop them from being themselves. It started
                                        in
                                        university campuses all over the western world and has evolved into other
                                        different
                                        areas such as workplaces. The most common safe spaces are dedicated to women,
                                        LGBTQ+
                                        individuals, racialized people, and different religious backgrounds. The
                                        beginning
                                        of this movement always implied physical places where people could meet, but
                                        nowadays the discussion has moved to the internet world. With a society that is
                                        moving more and more towards a technological future and the upcoming generations
                                        joining the net sooner every time, the internet usage is something we all are or
                                        will be confronting sooner than later. </p>

                                            where younger and marginalized people can stay without receiving any harm.

                                        Humans are sociable beings and we build communication and networks in mostly
                                        every
                                        action we do, even if it is with ourselves, and safe spaces are the perfect tool
                                        to help
                                        us understand each other better and have healthier relationships. It provides a
                                        background for ostracised people to present themselves how they are without fear
                                        of
                                        being judged or harassed. Combining this with methods and resources to improve
                                        someone’s
                                        conflict processing and resolution would develop superhumans for the future
                                        generations,
                                        because it’s not just a direct impact over the individual, but they way they
                                        live, work,
                                        relate to others, etc. Feeling better with yourself will make you happier and
                                        more
                                        productive in general, and that’s something everybody should aim for.

                                        With that in present, there must be some guidelines along its policies to ensure
                                        everyone’s voice is being heard and that the freedom of one is not the prison of
                                        others.
                                        Limiting someone’s opinion wouldn’t allow both parts to grow in any means: Every
                                        opinion
                                        should be valid (that differs from right or wrong) as long the person is willing
                                        to
                                        listen for positive feedback and ways to improve in case they are taking the
                                        wrong
                                        approach for that situation.
